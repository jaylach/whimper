# overview
whimper is, in reality, just a pretty api around managing and running JavaScirpt functions. It stays out of your way and 
lets you do what you do best: write code. It's simple yet eloquent. Compared to other task runners out there, it really
ends not with a bang but a whimper.

whimper is ...
- lightweight and out of your way
- built on promises
- just JavaScirpt functions
- plugin free! (more below)
- not globally installed (more below)
